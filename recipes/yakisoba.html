        <dt>Yakisoba:</dt>
        <dd>Yakisoba is a classic Japanese stir-fried noodle dish that's seasoned with a sweet and savory sauce similar to Worcestershire sauce. Use any proteins you like: pork, chicken, shrimp, or calamari. For vegetarians, just swap it with tofu or shiitake mushrooms.</dd>

<h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>
<h4>8 servings</h4>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages buckwheat soba noodles</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut against the grain in thin strips</li>
    <li>2 cups carrots, cut into julienne strips</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, cut into julienne strips</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>½ head napa cabbage, shredded</li>
    <li>⅔ cup yakisoba sauce</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons pickled red ginger (beni shoga), or to taste</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons kizami nori (dried flaked aonori seaweed), or to taste</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook soba in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add pork and stir-fry with a pinch of salt and pepper, about 5 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate, reserving oil in wok. Add carrots, onion, ginger, and garlic to the wok and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add cabbage to the wok and stir-fry briefly, about 1 minute. Add drained soba noodles. Pour in 1/2 the yakisoba sauce and stir-fry until noodles and vegetables are covered with sauce, about 3 minutes. Return pork to the wok. Add additional sauce as desired. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Garnish yakisoba with kizami nori and a small pile of beni shoga just before serving.</li>
</ol>
